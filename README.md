# SurfCon
Implementation of SurfCon model for Paper "[SurfCon: Synonym Discovery on Privacy-Aware Clinical Data](https://github.com/yzabc007/SurfCon/)",which studies Synonym Discovery on Privacy-Aware Clinical Data.

## 1. Introduction
This repository is the implementation for the SurfCon model which utilizes the surface form and global context information to mine synonyms for medical terms extracted from Electronic Medical Records (EMRs).

## 2. Dataset
The dataset used in current experiments contains medical term-term co-occurrence graphs extracted from EMRs. The dataset can be downloaded from the original paper, [Building the graph of medicine from millions of clinical narratives](https://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.jp917)

There are some inputs that need to be prepared before running.
